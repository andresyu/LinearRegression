Linear Regression; Different Implementations Between Framework And Non Framework

The main objective of this 2 linear regression implementations is to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) 
of a combined cycle power plant as well as to see the different result of both implementations. The dataset contains 9568 
data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006â€“2012), when the power plant was set to work with 
full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) 
and Exhaust Vacuum (V).
